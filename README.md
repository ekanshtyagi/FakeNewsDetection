# FakeNewsDetection
ML Project to detect the accuracy of a Collection Algorithm for detecting fake news in a pre labelled dataset. In this project the 'Passive Aggressive Classifier' collection algorithm is used with the help of pandas library to detect the accuracy of our training models. The code also makes use of TfIdfVectorizer to help in the spiltting of the dataset.
